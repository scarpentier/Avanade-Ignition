# Avanade Ignition Training
This Avanade new-hire training aims to put employees in a real client situation where we had 2 weeks to gather requirements and develop an application.

In this case, we were tasked to create a web-based insurance quotation tool.

This is the code that our team put together during those 2 weeks.
